#Tapecult

Tapecult is a web app project. The design intent was to make a simple music player, with an intuitive and clean UI. Also
it was important that it looked great on mobile browsers. 

The term Tapecult is meant to refer to the cult like behavior people had when trading cassette tapes of thier favorite live
shows. The side menu has a collection of long-form deep house music tracks. The "Artist Name : Track Title" is a link to the
artist's Soundcloud page, where the track can be found. The Soundcloud logo is placed to the right to represent the use
of Soundcoud.

+ Soundcloud's API is used to supply the music streams 
+ The animated music player came from Travis Neilson of DevTips https://twitter.com/travisneilson
+ Yahoo's purecss.io framework was used to create the side-menu (paired back and heavily style modified)
+ jQuery javascript library is used 

This is my first web app, and I refactored this project many times. Any suggestions on how to improve the code is appreciated.
